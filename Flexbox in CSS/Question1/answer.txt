The main diffrence between using flexbox and grid is that in grid you have the access to 2-dimensional layouting,
which is not in the case of flexbox.

So, using grid you can layout your webpage in a 2-dimensional system and on the top of that grid, 2-dimensional
layouting system is completely responsive as well in both horizontal and vertical directions as well, which is 
not the case in flexbox.


Since, grid is very powerful as we can layouting in 2-dimensional fashion so we will use the grid layouting system
over the flexbox layout when we want to design 2-dimensional structure of webpage and we want our webpage to 
be responsive in both horizontal and vertical directions as well.
