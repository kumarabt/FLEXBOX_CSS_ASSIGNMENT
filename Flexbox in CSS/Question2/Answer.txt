1. JUSTIFY-CONTENT : a. It is used in case of flexbox when we have to align items on the main axis i.e. 
                     bydefault horizontal and can be changed using flex direction property.

                     b. This property is used at parent level which is marked as display flex to align 
                     items/childs under it on the main axis.

                     c. Justify-content can be set to flex-start, flex-end and center etc., we can also 
                     set it for spacing between items as space-around, space-between and space-evenly etc.

                     d. SYNTAX: .parent{
                                        display:flex;
                                        justify-content:center;
                                       }


2. ALIGN-ITEMS     : a. It is used in case of flexbox when we have to align items on the cross axis i.e.
                     perpendicular to main axis and bydefault the cross axis is set to be vertical axis.

                     b. This property is also given at parent level which is marked as display flex to 
                     align items/childs under it on the cross axis.

                     c. Align-items can be set to flex-start, flex-end and center etc., we can also 
                     set it for spacing between items as space-around, space-between and space-evenly etc.
                    
                    
                     d. SYNTAX: .parent{
                                        display:flex;
                                        align-items:center;
                                       }


3. GAP            : a. As the name suggests gap property in flexbox is used to set gap between the child items.
                    
                    b. This property is also given at parent level which is marked as display flex.
                    
                    c. We can also set the gap between rows and columns seprately by using the individual gap 
                    properties i.e. row-gap and column gap respectively.

                    d. SYNTAX: .parent{
                                        display:flex;
                                        gap : 2px;
                                       }


4. FLEX-DIRECTION: a. Flex-direction is a property used in flex-box container to determine the direction
                      of the main-axis in the flexbox.
                   
                   b. For making main-axis as horizontal we can mark flex-direction as row and for making
                      main axis as vertical we can mark flex-direction as column.

                   c. By-default the flex-direction is set to be row which can be changed according to our
                      usecase.

                   d.  SYNTAX: .parent{
                                        display:flex;
                                        flex-direction:row;
                                       }


5. FLEX-WRAP   : a. BY-defalut flex places all items in a single line i.e. the main axis.
                 b. i.e. by-default flex wrap is set to be no-wrap.
                 c. Now, if we want to move the extra item to the next line we have to wrap it by using
                 Flex-wrap:wrap;.
                 d. Flex-wrap can be set to no-wrap, wrap and wrap-reverse.
                 e. According to child width it will wrap child items.
                 f.  SYNTAX: .parent{
                                        display:flex;
                                        flex-wrap:no-wrap;
                                       }
